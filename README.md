The Rust implementations are the least complete but, being the latest, are most likely to be correct (e.g. the ECB byte-at-a-time decryption wasn't correctly interpreted / implemented in the Python and F# versions).

## Python

Python 2.7 implementations were done for Sets 1 and 2, and part of Set 4. It is now deprecated, but can still be used as reference and is easy to port to Python 3.

## F#

The F# 4.1 implementations are the most complete, covering Sets 1 - 6, excepting the problems in Set 4 that require server interactions.

## Rust

The latest set of implementations, a work in progress.
